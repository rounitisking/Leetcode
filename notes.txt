                -- bcz -- The command npx prisma db push

👉 syncs your Prisma schema with the database directly — without creating migration files.
🧩 In short:


🏗️ It creates or updates tables in your database based on your current schema.prisma.


🚫 It does NOT generate or track migrations.


⚙️ Used mostly during early development or prototyping.



✅ Example:
If you added a new model in schema.prisma and run
npx prisma db push

then Prisma will instantly create that table in your DB — fast and simple.
💡 But for production or version-tracked setups, use
npx prisma migrate dev

because that one keeps migration history.
